# Terraform  module \aws\glue Terraform module

## Description

In this directory you can find the Terraform module for creating a Glue resources in AWS.

All code is found in the sub-modules and you should use the examples as a base to create your own configuration, note that most of the code is used for testing purposes and should be adapted to your needs when ran in Production.

[Glue Catalog Module](./modules/catalog/README.md)

Examples available [`here`](github.com/boldlink/terraform-aws-glue/tree/main/examples)

## Usage
*NOTE*: These examples use the latest version of this module

```console
module "miniumum" {
  source  = "boldlink/glue/aws"
  version = "x.x.x"
  <insert the minimum required variables here if any are required>
  ...
}
```

## Third party software
This repository uses third party software:
* [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) - Used to help ensure code and documentation consistency
  * Install with `brew install pre-commit`
  * Manually use with `pre-commit run`
* [terraform 0.14.11](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.14.11/) For backwards compatibility we are using version 0.14.11 for testing making this the min version tested and without issues with terraform-docs.
* [terraform-docs](https://github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs) - Used to generate the [Inputs](#Inputs) and [Outputs](#Outputs) sections
  * Install with `brew install terraform-docs`
  * Manually use via pre-commit
* [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) - Used to lint the Terraform code
  * Install with `brew install tflint`
  * Manually use via pre-commit

### Supporting resources:

The example stacks are used by BOLDLink developers to validate the modules by building an actual stack on AWS.

Some of the modules have dependencies on other modules (ex. Ec2 instance depends on the VPC module) so we create them
first and use data sources on the examples to use the stacks.

Any supporting resources will be available on the `tests/supportingResources` and the lifecycle is managed by the `Makefile` targets.

Resources on the `tests/supportingResources` folder are not intended for demo or actual implementation purposes, and can be used for reference.

### Makefile
The makefile contain in this repo is optimized for linux paths and the main purpose is to execute testing for now.
* Create all tests stacks including any supporting resources:
```console
make tests
```
* Clean all tests *except* existing supporting resources:
```console
make clean
```
* Clean supporting resources - this is done separately so you can test your module build/modify/destroy independently.
```console
make cleansupporting
```
* !!!DANGER!!! Clean the state files from examples and test/supportingResources - use with CAUTION!!!
```console
make cleanstatefiles
```
